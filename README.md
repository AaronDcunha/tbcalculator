# TB Calcualtor
TB Calculator is made by Aaron D'Cunha and has a bunch of python programs that help calculate certain problems. The reasons I coded these were to ***TOTALLY*** not help me with my homework. They were fun projects for me to work on and I always wanted to make some of these calculators so here they are.
The source code is available for anyone to create a fork and improve on it. This project is open sourced
